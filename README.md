# Intro-to-Spatial-Data

## Part of the Carolina Analytics and Data Science Week of Workshops 2020

Location is an important, but often overlooked aspect of data science. In this Intro to Spatial Data workshop, youâ€™ll get an introduction to spatial data and data types, work on cleaning and manipulating spatial data sets, and learn how to add aspects of space and time to more conventional statistical methods in order to boost your data science skills! This workshop is geared towards those already familiar with R and RStudio, but beginners, especially those who attended Part 1 on Monday, are more than welcome to tag along!
